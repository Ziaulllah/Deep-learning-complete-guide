    "\n",
    "**LLM (Large Language Model)** is a **powerful AI model** trained to understand and generate **human-like text**.  \n",
    "It can **read, write, translate, summarize**, and even **chat** like a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚úÖ LLMs are trained on **massive amounts of text data** using deep learning techniques (especially transformers).\n",

    "1. **Embeddings** ‚Äì Turns words into numbers  \n",
    "2. **Self-Attention** ‚Äì Understands context in a sentence  \n",
    "3. **Feed-Forward Layers** ‚Äì Learns patterns in the data  \n",
    "4. **Output Layer** ‚Äì Predicts the next word/token\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚öôÔ∏è LLMs use **many layers (like 96+ layers)** and **billions of parameters** (e.g., GPT-3 has 175B).\n",
