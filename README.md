📘 Deep Learning – Complete Guide

Welcome to the Deep Learning – Complete Guide repository!
This repo is a structured collection of Jupyter Notebooks covering everything from the basics of neural networks to advanced topics like CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and Transfer Learning.

It is designed as a step-by-step roadmap for anyone who wants to learn Deep Learning from scratch through both theory and hands-on practice.

🛠️ Topics Covered
✅ Basics of Deep Learning & Neural Networks
✅ Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with projects
✅ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) – architectures & history
✅ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTMs, GRUs, Bidirectional RNNs
✅ Transformers & Attention Mechanisms (LLMs, Encoder-Decoder)
✅ Transfer Learning (feature extraction & fine-tuning)
✅ Hands-on projects (Churn Prediction, MNIST, Graduate Admission, Age/Gender Classification)
